	<h2>Outreach</h2>
	<p>Over multiple years, The Blair Robot Project has demonstrated their robots at school events including 
	science fairs and festivals, such as the <Takoma Park Middle School Science Festival and the Silver Spring Maker Faire. Every year, The Blair Robot 
	Project holds an annual demonstration and bake sale in Downtown Silver Spring, a local hotspot, for the public to 
	come out learn about the team and FIRST Robotics. Members of The Blair Robot Project have also supported and promoted 
	FIRST in community schools, like the Oyster Adams Bilingual School in Washington, D.C, by mentoring local FLL teams. 
	The Blair Robot Project has participated in Females in Science and Technology workshops where team members lead hands-on 
	robotic activities for middle school girls from across the county. The Blair Robot Project demonstrations are always a 
	crowd favorite at community gatherings. The pride that the students exude when talking about their robot during these 
	community events is gratifying to the team mentors and is an indicator of the magnitude of the programâ€™s impact.</p>
