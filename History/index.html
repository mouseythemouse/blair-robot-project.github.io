	<h2>History</h2>
		<p>The Blair Robot Project, based in Silver Spring, MD, was founded in 2000 and has competed in FIRST every year since 
		then, except for 2005. In 2004, our team was part of the three-team alliance that won the Chesapeake Regional Competition. </p>
		
		<p>In <b>2015</b>, we attended the Greater DC and Chesapeake Regional Competitions. At the Greater DC Regional, we were chosen 
		for an alliance. Unfortunately, our alliance lost in the quarterfinal rounds. At the Chesapeake Regional, we finished 11th out 
		of 57 teams and were chosen for an alliance.</p>
		
		<p>In <b>2014</b>, we attended the North Carolina and Greater DC Regional Competitions. At the North Carolina Regional, we 
		were chosen for an alliance. We made it to the quarterfinal rounds. At the Greater DC Regional, we finished 10th out of 
		60 teams and we were chosen for an alliance. Our alliance made it to the semifinal round. In addition, our team captain 
		won the Dean's List Finalist award.</p>
		
		<p>In <b>2013</b>, we attended the Pittsburgh and Chesapeake Regional Competitions. At the Pittsburgh Regional, we were 
		alliance captains, but we were eliminated in the quarterfinal rounds. At the Chesapeake Regional, we were the 6th seeded 
		alliance captains and led our teams to the quarterfinals. At Pittsburgh, our head non-technical mentor received the Woodie 
		Flowers Finalist award.</p>
		
		<p>In <b>2012</b>, we attended the Washington, D.C. and Chesapeake Regional Competitions. At the DC Regional, we were unable 
		to qualify for the top 8 teams, and none of the team captains chose us for their alliance. However, our robot performed consistently 
		well throughout the qualifying rounds – a first for Blair Robotics. At the Chesapeake Regional we finished the qualifying 
		rounds as the 8th seed alliance captain. After fixing our technical difficulties, we were able to make it to semifinals before 
		being eliminated by a very worthy opponent. At this regional, our team president won the Dean’s List Finalist award.</p>
		
		<p>In <b>2011</b>, we competed in the DC and North Carolina regionals. In DC, we made were the 5th team chosen to be alliance 
		captains after the qualifiers. At North Carolina, we did much better; With a little bit of luck, a lot of teamwork with 
		alliance members, and a lot of skill on the part of our drive team, we finished 1st place overall. Unfortunately, many of the 
		teams rejected us as a potential alliance member. In order to get to the semifinals, we picked a rookie team and also the 
		best defensive robot there. At the end of the North Carolina regional we came in third place overall, a team best.</p>
		
		<p>In <b>2010</b>, we competed in the DC and North Carolina regionals for “Breakaway.” We made it to the semifinals at the 
		DC regional but missed the finals cutoff by one match. Then in the North Carolina Regionals, we made it to the semifinals.</p>
		
		<p>In <b>2009</b>, we competed in the DC and Chesapeake Regionals for the game Lunacy. After our DC Regional finish, 
		we completely retooled our robot in an effort to improve at the Chesapeake Regional. Our newly redesigned robot earned us 
		7th place out of 55 teams, at this time our highest seeded finish.</p>
		
		<p>In <b>2008</b>, we competed in two regionals of the 2008 FIRST Robotics Competition, FIRST Overdrive. At the New Jersey 
		Regional, we were seeded 12 out of 63 teams and were picked by Team 1089, with team 1676 rounding out our alliance for 
		quarterfinals. We were lucky enough to win the Delphi Driving Tomorrow’s Technology Award for our design features. At the 
		Chesapeake Regional, we made it to the semifinals with Team 2234 and Team 341.</p>
