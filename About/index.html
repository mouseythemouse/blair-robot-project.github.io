	<h2>About</h2>
	<p>The Blair Robot Project, Team 449, is a US FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) team. Team 449 is based out of Montgomery Blair 
	High School located in Silver Spring, Maryland. Team 449 prides itself in having student members that participate in all 
	aspects necessary to compete in FRC competitions, such as designing, wiring, programming, and building the robot.</p>
	<p>In order to meet the requirements and challenges of the FRC, Team 449 teaches students the technical skills involved 
	in creating an awesome robot regardless of prior experiences. During Preseason, the focus is teaching new members skills in 
	their area of choice. These new team members may choose to focus on 5 different diverse areas by joining sub-teams specializing 
	in mechanics, programming, electronics, tech, and public relations. Both returning members and mentors help these rookie 
	members in learning the necessary skills to contribute to Team 449. Not only are these skills essential to participating 
	in the FIRST Robotics Competition, they will also serve the members in whatever career paths they choose to take.</p>
	<p>Team 449 also gives its members the opportunity to learn how to manage projects in a professional manner. Each sub-team 
	must create and implement their designs quickly and efficiently, since the build season for FRC is only six and a half weeks 
	long. The mentors teach students how to approach problems when development time is limited and also give input on designs. 
	Finally, Team 449 teaches students how to work together in groups. Every year during the game team members learn how essential 
	coordinated teamwork is.</p>
	<p>Outside of the build and competition season, we focus on reaching out to our local community. One of the core values of 
	FIRST is to spread interest in science, technology, engineering, and math. We demonstrate our robot at various public events, 
	within our school, and in the community. These outreach efforts not only allows us to spread interest in science and 
	engineering, but also give our members a chance to develop their public speaking skills and help generate interest about 
	science and engineering.</p>
